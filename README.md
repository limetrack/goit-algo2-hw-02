# Optimization of 3D Printer Queue and Rod Cutting Problem
## Task 1: 3D Printer Queue Optimization
This program optimizes the queue for 3D printing tasks by considering priorities and printer constraints. It groups models for simultaneous printing while ensuring that volume and item constraints are not exceeded.  

## Task 2: Rod Cutting Problem
This program finds the optimal way to cut a rod to maximize profit using two approaches:  
- Memoization (Top-Down Approach)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)

## How to Run
```
python optimize_print_queue.py
python rod_cutting_optimization.py
```
